# Hi, I’m @RedHatTurtle

## Me
I’m interested in numerical methods, computational physics and parallel computing. Currently my main project is a parallel CFD solver called FREI written in [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org), a parallel programming language developed by Cray/HPE. Since I had no experience with Chapel prior to this I'm constantly learning to use the language while fleshing out my Fluid Mechanics algoritms.

## [FREI](https://gitlab.com/RedHatTurtle/frei)
FREI is an open source project and is mainly developed in Gitlab although I try to keep an up to date mirror here on Github too.
If you're interested in contributing to it in any way feel free to contact me at RedHatTurtle at gmail.

## Other interests
I used to be a Fortran developer and I'm excited about the effort at [Fortran-Lang](https://fortran-lang.org) to build modern infrastructure for fortan development lika a package manager and rewritng Fortran77 libraries in modern Fortran (2018 is the more recent) dialects.
I'm also constantly tempted to try to contribute to projects I personaly use like Syncthing, NeoVIM, Tmux and more general Linux tools but I can´t find the time for it.
